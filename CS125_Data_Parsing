      ">There is little information regarding the diseases of wild tortoises. However, an upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) has been observed in desert tortoises in the western U.S. and in gopher tortoises in Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi. This disease is highly contagious and is transmitted by close contact between tortoises. Clinical signs of URTD include a clear or white nasal discharge, watery eyes, and swollen eyelids. Tortoises can be “silent carriers”, meaning that they have the disease but do not exhibit obvious signs. Mortality from this disease has been high in some desert tortoise populations, but little is known about the effect of the disease on gopher tortoise populations. The occurrence of URTD is a significant concern in regards to gopher tortoise relocation and restocking programs. There is always the threat that diseases can be introduced into established colonies when tortoises are relocated onto new sites. Captive tortoises, in particular, should not be released back into the wild. It is believed that the release of sick, captive tortoises may have been a factor in a 90% decline of desert tortoises on one California preserve.\n",
